You have something to fall back on\n- Invest in skill development (Skillshare, Books, Kindle, Audible)\n\n4.

It feeds back to what I was saying in the comments on another video, about euthanasia with animals. Vets put animals to sleep for a number of reasons, but the relevant one in this case is to relieve suffering. I can't quite wrap my head around that it's not available in the UK for terminally ill or those in chronic pain to have a legal way to end this suffering, when it's done up and down the country to animals. \nAdditionally, animals can't tell us and consent, whereas humans can- so why is this a dilemma?"", 'Ali Abdaal would there be a lot of support with doctors for the law to be changed?', 'Agreed - This is an archaic law and I think the law should be changed to reflect today\'s times and what is and isn\'t at the boundaries of medical advances.

Vets put animals to sleep to relieve suffering and I cannot wrap my head around it too, how euthanasia in certain cases is not available in the UK, when it would clearly be in the best interest of the patient to relive suffering at end of life stages.It is interesting to note that some 20 years ago euthanasia may have been performed on small animals because those may have been the limitations of veterinary intervention, whereas today, the very same conditions may be treatable. It is an interesting field that needs more research and support and perhaps open public debates. In cases of withdrawal of treatment, isn\'t that harsh? What kind of death would a patient have if they are in excruciating pain as a direct result of withdrawal of treatment, with perhaps hours or days of suffering before finally dying, as opposed to dying under euthanasia, quickly and with perhaps little pain because of its speed? Yet, withdrawal of treatment is somehow acceptable. A very gray line indeed. Arguably, it can be said its just semantics, because after all doing northing and withdrawing treatment may be constituted as ""doing harm""? And isn\'t euthanasia meant to mean ""a good death"" in Greek? I myself am unsure of how I feel about the subject, although, anybody reading the above may guess I am leaning on the pro side. Perhaps I am. However, if ever made legal, there would have to be clear guidelines so as to insure that the procedures and processes are not abused and death not occurring unnecessary.

Besides all the 'normal' ways, consider also the following:\n1.  Suicide by cop:  Someone does something that causes the police to kill them.\n2.  Suicide by criminal:  Someone does something that causes them to be killed by a criminal.\n(Even some police utilize this one so as to 'die a hero' and their family still can get benefits).\n3.  Suicide by 'accident':  Someone has an 'accident' that kills them.\n4.  Suicide by 'ignorance':  Whatever society tells people to do to stay healthy, do the opposite.\n\n*  Suicide numbers are probably higher than what is reported.  And suicide is not always connected with a mental illness as if often claimed:\n\n5.  Some military people go on 'suicide missions' for a greater cause.\n(And they are seen and treated as a hero.)\n6.  Some people risk their own life to try to save others.\n(And they also are seen and treated as a hero.)\n\n*  So, suicide can be done by a fully sane individual too.  For them, it's just the 'right' thing to do.  For a 'greater cause'.\n\n7.  And then also, some people who choose to die, can free up resources for those who want to continue to live.  (An act of charity and love).\n\n*  Suicide is claimed to be associated with mental illness, and that is simply not always true.\n\n*  Legalize suicide, or at least make suicide not illegal.  Doesn't a person have the individual 'right' to end their own life?  It's their life, isn't it?  Otherwise, society should be fully responsible for taking care of every single human's basic needs, otherwise, society is mandating an unfunded mandate, making people stay alive without providing the necessary resources to do so.  Society would be making 'slaves' of individuals for as long as the individuals are alive.  And not taking full care of those 'slaves' either.  And don't worry society, even where suicide is legal, there are still enough humans alive to keep society going.  Let those who want to end their own life, do so, legally.

It emphasizes that the ability to focus is a skill that can be learned.\n\nThe video outlines five actionable tips to improve focus:\n\n1. *Make a ready to resume plan:* When you need to switch between tasks, take a moment to create a plan for resuming the first task. This will help you to minimize attention residue, the lingering effects of the first task on your ability to focus on the second task.  An example of creating a ready to resume plan is stopping in the middle of a sentence when writing.\n\n2. *Listen to 40Hz binaural beats:* Binaural beats are auditory illusions created by playing two slightly different frequencies into each ear. Some research suggests that listening to 40Hz binaural beats can improve focus.\n\n3. *Declutter your workspace:* Physical and digital clutter can be distracting and make it difficult to focus. The video suggests setting aside 10 minutes to declutter your workspace before starting a focused work session.\n\n4. *Use the 90/20 rule:* The 90/20 rule suggests that we should work in 90-minute intervals followed by 15-30 minute breaks. This is because our brains tend to operate in 90-minute cycles, with alertness declining after 90 minutes of focused work.\n\n5. *Batch similar tasks together:* Color-coding your calendar to group similar tasks together can help you to improve focus by minimizing context switching.

He SLEEPS productively. Absolutely insane.', 'Here\'s are my takeaways from this video:\n*The ultimate way to have energy and never be tired is to get quality sleep every night, and to get enough of it*\nAli\'s suggestions ultimately revolve around how you can optimize your sleeping environment & habits so you can get the best sleep possible.\n1. Get blackout curtains - we get our best sleep when it\'s completely dark; make your room as ""cave-like"" as possible\n2. Cool the temperature - the optimal sleeping temperature is 66ºF, what can you do with windows, fan, or AC to get as close to that as possible?\n3. Try a breathing technique before bed - Ali suggests the Pilot\'s method, which is where you focus on relaxing your face muscles, then you focus on relaxing your legs, then you focus on relaxing your arms, and if you\'re still awake you focus on your breath and simply let thoughts gently glide out of your mind as they come in\n\n\n4. Get a physical alarm clock - this means the first thing you look at isn\'t your phone, and placing your alarm clock across the room forces you to actually get up out of bed to turn it off\n5. Avoid screens before bed - this one might just be the most challenging. My question to you: is there a way you could shift your screen-related activity from just before bed to the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning? This way you have something fun to look forward to when you wake up, you may find a little more motivation, and it helps your body\'s natural circadian rhythm\n6. No caffeine after 2PM - even if you feel immune to the effects of caffeine, studies are showing it still affects your body and your brain cells. Consider enjoying your caffeinated beverage of choice in the morning and refraining from having any more caffeine after 2PM\n\n7. (BONUS) Get 10 minutes of sunshine outside in the morning first thing when you wake up - looking at the blue sky activates photoreceptors in our skin, eyelids, and eyes that help us wake up and maintain our circadian rhythm. Consider ways you may incorporate time outdoors in your morning, for just 10 minutes, to enjoy these benefits.\n\nThat\'s all.

I\'m from Portugal, currently working on a middle-small sized hospital. \n\nMain differences about our days: you seem to have more responsibility prescribing drugs; we seem to have more Operating Theatre (OR) time. \n\nMy typical week: 1  day OR + 1 day consultations + 1 day emergency department + 2 days ward. We are 9 juniors at the department and we rotate. \n\n- OR day: we scrub in, but of course we only help the main surgeon. \n- Emergency department: we admit patients, collect histories, physical exam, suture when needed. We discuss with seniors for more complex exam requests and prescriptions (we are not legally allowed to prescribe ambulatory medicine)\n- Consultations: typical consults, with us accompanying the senior doctor. We do most physical examinations, some history taking... \n- Ward days: 8am 30, we start by dividing our patients between junior doctors; each of us checks on ""our"" patients for the day (talking with them  and their families, physical, checking vital signs and laboratory/imagiology exams); at around 10am we do the round with the seniors, and only then we discuss about the plans for the day (requesting more exams, discharge, prescriptions...). After that we take care of the discharge notes, go talk with other specialties for opinions, request exams...\n\nWe do not carry the ""bleep"", nor are we the first responders. There is always an emergency department team, responsible for that. And also our nurses are pretty capable of dealing with most stuff. We always ask for senior help when the nurses ask us what to do, when prescriptions are required. \n\nAlso, autopsies, when necessary, are ALWAYS done by doctors of legal medicine. Does not happen that often, in a typical hospital day.\n\nReferals are a part of our work as well. In Portugal, almost all of that is done through the informatic system. So, for example, if you need internal medicine to check on your patient, you request via the computer. We only go to them in person when we need to discuss something if we are not sure they can help, or when you just need an opinion an can do it yourself (general surgery doctors)\n\nWe always do arterial blood gases, not venous. When we need venous blood (for labs), the nurses collect it 99% of time. \n\nWe do not organize imagiology exams. We request them via digital system. When they are ""urgent"", we check on a box or write it in the request.  Imagiology takes care of the organization. Sometimes, when you REALLY need it, you go there in person and ask politely to make it a priority.\n\n\nGreat to see some differences in medical teaching worlwide. Very interesting. \n\nDo you suture at all?', ""Loved this video man! It was definitely comforting to hear that much about being a doctor isn't memorising all the facts!

The information is always available to every single person on this planet who's willing to look it up, medical school teaches you how to use that knowledge. Being a doctor is doable, but the competencies that enables you to become one are of so mucb importance and took you so much time to process and master. Something else I can point out since I'm still a medical student and see things differently from my POV is that studying a good amount of medical meterial makes you able to have this mental model in your head where you understand the pathologies that you see because you learnt them. When I see a pathology I haven't yet studied, I don't understand one bit of what the doctors are doing and cannot grasp the idea in a way that adds it to my memory because I have to first have a mental model of this illness which cannot be made unless I study it in depth and in all its details. What I'm trying to say is that unless you go through all that stuff in medical books, being organised and knowing a few bits here and there and knowing how to take a blood sample will surely not make you a good doctor (I'm organised and learnt how take blood samples and I sure as hell can run around to Lab and ask them to do stuff for me, but I'm way far from becoming a doctor haha). \nVery nice video Ali per usual, the podcast is also very nice and I can't wait for the next one.

As of today, the government wants to reactivate 5 000 doctors and 15 000 nurses from retirement, due to lack of staff. The average time spent in ICU in China is 14 days, which is worrying.

To be frank, a couple days ago I even started panicking a little. Ali's video helped me understand more about the virus and its risks, and helped me stop panicking. \n\n\nReading your comment though made me realize what the true problem is when it comes to COVID-19: the virus affects so many people, and those who need advanced medical treatment (like air ventilators and such) can be in the hospital for about 2 weeks. Because of this, hospitals are running out of doctors, nurses, and space to treat everyone who needs treatment. Even worse,  people who don't have COVID-19 but have other medical conditions can't get proper treatment either (this includes children, pregnant women, etc). \n\n\nSo this problem is more about how well we can use our resources, than it is about COVID-19 being unusually dangerous. As more people realize that, maybe we'll come up with some good solutions."", '"" the less fatal than the flu "". No. It\'s more mortal and dangerous than the flu. Even if it\'s more serious on older people, doesnt mean it\'s weaker. The dangerous part of it is surely overload medical system and lack of proper care for patient. But even more dangerous is that people in incubation state can get negative test result and infect more people, this forces the medical system to focus on  2 different aim simultaneously, 1 for taking care of the sick, 2 find and quarantine suspected case. This reduce the efficiency of the medical system. \n\r\nWhen the potentially infected case with mild or no symptom can already spread the virus, they underestimate it, thought it was a common flu or cold. They still go out in public without mask, and probably infected dozens of people until they experience more severe symptom then they go to hospital testing and get positive.  This applies for the patient number 17 in Vietnam who came back from France after having a LONDON - MILAN-LONDON - PARIS - HANOI travel route. Only after 4 days in Vietnam  was she confirmed to have positive test result.  For now, She has infected 4 people( all confirmed in Vietnam, her sister in London has infected too) , 101 have been put into quarantine for medical checkup.  The fact that controling the people who has interacted with patient who are in incubation state is extremely hard. This disease has infected and killed more people than SARS. I don\'t know after 2 months the virus broke out, the Western STILL not taking the mask problem seriously to mass produce them and cover their mouth ( even the fabric one helps). Seeing the number of patient countinue to sky rocketing in the EU and US. ""Experts"" keep telling wearing mask won\'t have or worsen the problem. This is the reason why the one who aware of the disease get bullied by wearing mask, but the sicks keep running around and sneeze and cough into the public.', ""@@BiancaAguglia You are definitely right, but even the best medical system in the world has its limits. People criticise radical solutions and travel bans, but the most we can do now is to make sure that the disease doesn't spread that much.

Vietnam doesn’t test as much as other countries such as Sweden, Japan... and naturally there are much less cases. Because you are not actually actively testing the population that much.

Regarding masks you need ppf2 at least for protection against viral diseases, but I do agree that everyone should use masks even if they are fiber or surgery masks.

That doctor’s mother just came back from vacationing in a possibly endemic country, she was tested at the airport and the test came negative, but then she became sick and her condition continued to worsen, went to a GP who managed her symptomatically ( as he assumed that she was not having the virus coz she already tested negative). Finally decided to come to the hospital, where she was tested again and her results came positive, so she was directly admitted. \r\nThe thing is that the daughter ( the doctor) had also been sneezing, only sneezing, no cough no fever, nothing, and had just attended a wedding party the day prior (and in my country we do have the custom of hugging and kissing everyone on the cheek especially on happy occasions, corona or not apparently) so she did that but after her mother’s diagnosis she thought to herself, why not get myself tested too, coz .. who knows. And to her surprise her test came positive too. \r\nOn top of all that, this particular doctor have been rotationing in the internal medicine department in our hospital until the morning of that day. \r\nSo amongst her contacts, who are supposedly going to be tested for it, are all the people at the wedding including the bride, many doctors in the internal medicine department, and other departments as well, and all the patients she came in contact with over the past days. So now we are just waiting for the influx of patients in the coming few days.\r\nthis is only one story of many, as each admitted patient would have their own huge list of contacts.\nbut up until hearing this story I was just going about my life as usual thinking that its highly unlikely that I get infected. Now It feels like  I am surrounded with the disease, and that I should be taking things more seriously, if I value my life, my family’s lives and the lives of the people around me, that is.\r\n\r\nAnd to make everything worse, one of the 60 infected patients in my country, a man in his sixties, have deteriorated from requiring only airvo to requiring an ICU admission and full support with mechanical ventilation and is still deteriorating further and is expected to pass any time now to be the first death case in our country.\n\r\nIt’s a really serious thing. I hope everyone stays alert and safe.', 'yikes.

Setting intentional defaults\n- Ali talks about the importance of setting intentional defaults in order to improve your life.\n- One default to consider is how you spend your spare time.\n- Instead of defaulting to work, try defaulting to reconnecting with friends or doing something intentional with relationships.\n- He has been testing this out over the last few weeks and has found it to be beneficial.\n\n02:14 - Lowering the bar\n- The idea of lowering the bar is helpful for dealing with procrastination because it allows you to get started.\n- If you are struggling with procrastination, it is likely because your standards are too high.\n- Telling yourself to lower the bar and embrace mediocrity can help you get started.\n- Once you get started, it is easier to continue going.\n\n03:25 - Embracing mediocrity in certain areas\n- We cannot do everything and we need to accept mediocrity in some areas.\n- Oliver Bergman\'s book ""Four Thousand Weeks"" talks about this idea.\n- We should focus on what is important to us and let go of the things that are not.\n- This can help reduce stress and anxiety in our lives.\n\n04:52 - Living with a background music track\n- Ali suggests that listening to background music can help increase energy levels.\n- He finds that when he doesn\'t have background music, his energy levels are lower.\n- Music can help with focus and concentration.\n- Having background music can make life more fun and high energy.\n\n06:12 - Consistency and quantity generally leads to quality\n- Consistency and quantity leads to quality.\n- This is a standard life lesson that everyone who is aware of personal development and stuff knows, but always needs reminding of.\n- You need to just do a lot of something in order to get good at it.\n- This can be applied to things like making videos, writing songs, or even going to the gym.\n- As long as you\'ve done at least one thing that counts towards your goal, that\'s a win.\n\n07:18 - Quantity and consistency lead to creativity\n-Quantity and consistency leads to creativity.\n-The more you do the thing, the more creativity flows from you.\n- In order to be creative, you have to let all of the crap flow out first.\n- Doing anything daily makes me way more creative than I would be otherwise.\n\n08:08 - Sending physical thank you notes feels good\n- Sending physical thank you notes feels good for both the sender and the recipient.\n- There is something about a handwritten note that makes it extra special.\n- Students in YouTuber Academy love receiving handwritten notes from their teachers.\n- Sending physical thank you notes is a great way to make someone\'s day.\n- Writing thank you notes is a small but impactful gesture that can make a big difference in someone\'s life.\n\n08:34 - Planning and doing are two different modes of operating\n- Planning and doing are two different modes of operation.\n- It is hard to get started if you try to be the pilot and the plane at the same time in the same sitting.\n- Procrastination can be beaten by separating planning and doing.\n- Coming up with a plan before starting something can help you execute better when you\'re in the middle of it.\n\n09:42 - Choosing to be satisfied\n- It’s better to choose to feel satisfied with one\'s accomplishments at the end of the day, rather than beating oneself up for not having done more.\n- Feeling dissatisfied with one\'s progress does not lead to increased productivity the next day.\n- Choosing to feel satisfied instead can lead to a positive spiral of feeling good about one\'s progress.\n- Feeling dissatisfied with one\'s accomplishments can be a negative spiral that leads to less productive days.\n\n10:52 - Move towards things that energise rather than drain\n- We should try to move towards things that energize us, rather than things that drain us.\n- This can be a useful mental model for making decisions about how we spend our time.\n- If we have the option, we should choose things that energize us over things that drain us.\n- This can help us to enjoy our time more and feel more motivated.\n\n12:10 -

COhm-736828,"['Ali! Thanks for hosting me on the channel. I literally flew halfway across the world for this collaboration and it was totally worth it. \n\nNow that the video is live, I want to provide some more color about why people should get started as online writers, regardless of whether they want to eventually start a blog or a YouTube channel. \n\n1. Attract friends and business partners: It\'s hard to meet people as passionate about learning as you are. But when you publish your ideas, you attract people who think like you. The more niche the topic, the easier it is to attract people on your intellectual wavelength.\n\n2. Writing helps you understand yourself. All of us have unprocessed feelings and emotions. Writing is the best way to identify what\'s making you uncomfortable. By writing, you gain clarity in your life. The increased clarity you receive reduces stress and anxiety in your life.\n\n3. Writing accelerates your learning: If you want to understand a topic better, start teaching it. The act of putting ideas into your own words tattoos them into your mind. As James Clear once said: ""If you think you can learn a lot by reading a book, try writing one.""\n\n4. Writing makes you more observant: Whenever you write something, new parts of the world come alive. Every experience, every conversation, and everything you read becomes a potential future sentence. That\'s why writing regularly wakes you up and makes your mind come alive.\n\n5. Writing establishes expertise: Excellent essays attract excellent people. If you write well about a topic, the world\'s experts will reach out to you. Since writing is a record of your best ideas, your essays will double as a resume that demonstrates your intellectual rigor.\n\n6. Writing will accelerate your career: Good writers are clear thinkers and clear thinkers are rewarded at work. By writing, you can gain outsized influence in your company and establish yourself as an industry expert, which will attract opportunities.\n\n7. Writing attracts opportunities: Every article you publish is like a serendipity vehicle. High-level people who resonate with your ideas will reach out to you with career opportunities you couldn\'t have imagined. Thus, writing maximizes your surface area of exposure to luck.\n\n8. Writing improves your thinking: Mathematicians put their ideas on the whiteboard because writing out your ideas lets you tackle harder problems. Writing is the same. By putting ideas onto the page, you can transcend the limits of scattered thinking and explore ideas deeply.\n\n9. Writing online forces you to think better: Thinking in public raises your standard for quality. When I was a kid, our house was always cleanest when guests would come over. The same is true for writing. You think better when you know you\'re going to be seen and critiqued.\n\nFinally, I think it\'s worth answering one more question: Why is now the time to write?\n\nIt\'s never been easier for average people to share their ideas. If you write well, your ideas will find their way to some of the smartest and most successful people in the world. As your reputation grows, so will the opportunities available to you.\n\nWriting regularly is one of the best habits you can build. \n\nIf you want to learn the craft of online writing, sign up for my free 50-day email course: https://dperell.com/50-days-of-writing', 'This needs to be pinned!', 'Just subscribed to your course.

The transition to move from pen and paper to Kindle Scribe was as seamless as the integration between the Kindle app and the Scribe tablet. It feels so natural that I never missed pen and paper. \n\nWhat stands out for me is that it's not a full tablet so no apps and distractions. I have multiple folders for work, personal, etc. It's light weight and easy to carry. Battery time is very impressive for my ADHD brain, and I love the fact that I don't have to charge the pen.

You're both focused on a different audience. I don't think it's on you to make the best mechanical keyboard at the best price. That would be on him if he made one. Which is why he won't, because it's not really feasible at his scale. You have a different audience that expects something completely different. For example, I'm a record producer. If my audience bought a cooking pan from me, they should expect a cooking pan that makes sense for another record producer at a fair price. That's not your lane. It's his. Just as if he made productivity videos, no one would expect them to be like yours. Don't beat yourself up. What you did makes sense and being reviewed by someone like him is an unfair place to put yourself in. I'm not a cook. You're not a custom keyboard builder. - And to be clear, what HipyoTech did wasn't wrong either. It was perfect for his audience. No reason you both need to please the other's subscribers."", '\u200b@@REAPERMania The pan analogy doesn\'t really make sense as a pan has nothing to do with what you do. If you were to produce a peripheral related to what you do, I\'d hope that you\'d make it good and not just market the shit out of it while being a very poor value offering in comparison to the rest of the market. For instance, if you made a MIDI keyboard, priced it to compete with the higher-end of the market, and your product had the quality of a competitor at half the price, you made a bad call. It doesn\'t matter if you aren\'t making it for ""MIDI Keyboard enthusiasts"", you made a bad product that your audience is going to buy because your name is attached to it.\n\nNo one expected Ali to create a keyboard for keyboard enthusiasts, but he definitely could have done better in providing a fairly priced peripheral that he approved of to his audience.\n\nRespect to Ali for facing criticism head on, he clearly cares about making the right decisions, but let\'s call a spade a spade here, he made a mistake.', ""@@thatmfdiego A pan is still something I use in my life. Record producers also need to eat. A mechanical keyboard isn't something that you need for productivity either. If it makes you more productive, use one. But this product does what it claims to do. It's a good mechanical keyboard, it looks nice and if you like it, it may make you more productive. It's a bit expensive but so are other luxury items. I paid $80 for a desk pad that is made of felt. Way overpriced but the difference between $30 and $80 isn't that big of a deal for me. Just as a $159 keyboard isn't a big deal for me. My daily driver was $105 but I have about 6 keyboards and many of them are over $250. All overpriced if you ask me. If mechanical keyboards are your hobby, you probably wouldn't buy this keyboard unless you happen to love the choices and look. But it's not a bad product. Had he made a great mechanical keyboard, it would have easily cost $350 with the way things scale for a creator like him.  And I would argue asking your fans to spend $350 would be a real scummy thing to do as great keyboards are available for around $100. This one costs more because it's coming from a smaller creator. Not a huge corporation."", ""Show me a man who hasn't failed, and I'll show you a man who has never tried.

This is obviously a fairly calculated move and the real item he's trying to protect is the 5k courses which the keyboard video and comments also ragged on.

It's your job to pick product cases that has a high margin before engaging the project. \nImagine you had to sell the keyboard to a distributor, who then had to sell it to dealer, before it reached the end user. How would the MSRP look then? I would guess north of 250USD.\n\nCutting out the distributor and dealer in the pricing model is a huge advantage and allows you to spend even more than normal on manufacturing costs (better materials, components etc), OR have higher profits so the product case can cover for other products that didn't work, or be put towards additional company growth. \nYou priced it at 130usd MSRP (ex. vat)  from a manufacturing cost of 70usd, but imo that's a good 40usd higher manufacturing cost than you'd normally see on a 130usd ex. vat product.\n\nSometimes, you have industries where the big players have the volume, but only the low volume companies (often solo developers / power users) know what features the end user wants.\n In these cases, if you're a product expert, you can seize the opportunity to make a product that is designed better than the high volume competitors. But you have to be GOOD at the products and understanding the market trends.\nI think there are these opportunities in the tech scene."", ""This my be one of my favourite videos from your channel.

You're the first person I've heard cast any doubt on the culture around work experience and the expectation of these moments and it is a great relief at this stage in the process. I was really clutching at straws to find these moments for my PS, because I've so often been told that it's just not enough to say you love science and people without the eureka moments to support it. I have gained a lot from work experience, having no prior experience of hospitals or careers in medicine (I also volunteer weekly in hospital), but the vast majority of the time I do feel excluded from the goings on of the wards and therefore I just don't enjoy it. I'm glad that it is a requirement as I know a lot of people who have been put off medicine by it, but I do think the culture of 'if you don't like work experience then you shouldn't become a doctor' is off putting."", 'Medicine truly is a beautiful profession ❤️', ""Honestly I'm in the same shoe concerning this whole work experience thing.

I did get interviews though even without work experience though it is a bit strange as you said not to have it. But I honestly think I learnt and felt a lot more at the orphanage than I ever did at the hospital and it wasn't because I was discouraged by the hospital environment or I don't want to be a doctor or something but simply because of how volunteering made me feel, see and learn a great deal more."", ""I enjoyed both volunteering and working as a care assistant in a dementia care home, and as a healthcare assistant in the Neuro ICU and witnessing surgeries. But to be honest for me it was a bit different. What I am most grateful for is that my work experience as a whole was like a learning curve for me and it helped me in my day to day life with my confidence, for example. \n\nI already had a background in neuroscience when I started to 'tick my work experience list'' and have taken part in some studies about dementia so I was familiar with the signs of dementia and the pathological basis of Alzheimer's Parkinson's etc but never interacted with a patient in real life before. So on my first day as a carer in a dementia care home, I started crying because I was overwhelmed with how much suffering it can be in such a place. I was also very distressed because I didn't know how to interact with such patients, so felt that I was causing them more harm than good because, for example, I didn't know how to ask questions in the right way. Sometimes with these patients, you kinda know you are not going to get an answer back even though they might understand you. So I felt that I was putting them on great distress and sort of reminding them that they can not speak or move. But I learnt to do that and everything changed when I became to feel useful. \n\nBut this was helpful for another reason. It helped in my next job more than I thought, which was in a Neurological Intensive Care Unit. I used to be a very ''weak'' person in the sense that I was fainting every time I was seeing a person having a seizure or having a painful injury. So obviously I wasn't going to be any good to a patient if I was fainting. But because I become used, sort of speak, with a degree of patient suffering, I found it easier to adapt to see patients having awful injuries coming straight away from ED or surgical theatres (for the record, I almost fainted when seeing patient intubation).\n\nBut this prepared me for the next step which was to witness a cardiac surgery and bypass (basically I witnessed a patient being cut in half with the surgeons digging inside his body and try to lift the heart and put some ''tissues'' inside him to deal with the bleeding. My family couldn't believe that I was able to see this after always telling me I can't be a doctor because I am too soft.\n\nSo for me, my work experience did help me to grow as a person and gain a lot more confidence in myself but I appreciate volunteering just as much but for different reasons."", ""I'm from Botswana and I've subscribed to your page, its very helpful, and I'm awaiting responses from medical schools in the UK.

I can completely imagine that as an A-Level student these placements don't really leave you feeling like you've learnt a great deal, the pace of medicine is such that its hard to bring work experience students along a journey with you because they simply lack basic medical knowledge through absolutely no fault of their own!

The challenges faced by medical professionals often related to chronic and untreatable patients who made them feel powerless in the face of suffering, being overworked and burnt out, and struggling to have a family without sacrificing their career.

These relatively minor cons of a career in medicine were useful to be aware of before entering the degree."", 'Another amazing video. Thanks for all your help', ""Keep at it Ali, it's only a matter of time. Too much love, YC."", 'Katherine is the best!!', 'So so grateful for all of this <33', ""I really appreciate your reflections toward the end of the video. I am based in the U.S. and I'm wondering why the system is so that is 4 years of undergrad and then 4 years of medical school here? I think it would be beneficial to provide an option for U.S. students to enter medical school as part of a 6 year program after high school.\xa0\n\nI volunteered in a hospital before uni. The most meaningful part of that experience was relating to the patients. My duty consisted mainly of transporting patients to and from their rooms for cardiology services. Years after uni (I studied something other than medicine in uni) I decided I wanted to consider medical school again. However, that wasn't my primary motivation. I wanted to find a job that would give me flexibility to purse something I'm truly  passionate about while also opening an avenue to build clinical work experience in case I wanted to pursue medicine.\n\n I was accepted into a program working in a clinic where they would train me as a technician and medical scribe. It sounded ideal from the outside. I would work 4 days a week, 12 hour days. Most students accepted into the program had a background in emergency medicine (firefighters, nursing students, phlebotomists, paramedics). I was the odd ball. The program was geared to look very good as experience for applying to medical school or physician assistant school (which appears to be a growing trend here in the U.S.). The program was very intense. To say that in 3 weeks I was drawing blood and putting in IVs on real patients without prior experience before the program! Even though I did it and the very qualified trainers had full confidence I could graduate from the program, the amount of anxiety and stress turned out not to be worth the price I was paying psycho-physiologically. If I wanted to pursue medicine I would have to go through it, but I realized I didn't wanted medicine that bad to undergo the kind of sacrifice on my own health the program required. I witnessed how many co-workers had very poor health, were overworked, sleep deprived, and smoked or drank to cope.\n\nIn principle, working in an urgent care (emergency medicine backbone) setting, reminded me of working in a kitchen or fast food restaurant. Although it was efficient and got patients in and out, it was focused on popping patients out with a prescription. Although I see a place for emergency medicine and prescriptions, the medicine I was drawn to, the one that attracted me years before in my volunteering days as a teenager was the relational side of the business. At the urgent care, I enjoyed the patient consultations, running the tests on the high tech machines, and actually trying to find the root cause of the problem.\xa0That's when I realized I was practicing on the wrong side of medicine. I really enjoyed working with very smart, quirky, focused, and passionate people on very hard problems and feeling the spirit of collaboration and teamwork. The serious nature of the work really pulled in a quality of human being who inspired me to pursue hard things that are worthwhile.\n\nI'll always remember that time when the president and chief medical officer came to welcome our humble class of seven during our training. He was a military veteran who recounted how the military places such great responsibility and accountability on young men and women entering the military at 17. In his experience the best of a person is brought out when faced with greater responsibility and accountability. I agree. He figured if the U.S. gives that level of trust and mentorship to up-and-coming soldiers, the same could be done in the health care setting to up-and-coming medical professionals. He said all worthwhile things worth pursuing are hard. This is something I recall on occasion when I am pursuing worthwhile things beyond medicine."", ""Hiya, \nSo I'm a graduate applicant and I've been a HCA for a year. I did my UG in Tropical Disease Biology, as such it was a logical and interesting step for me to undertake some work experience at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases/UCL HTD.\n\nTo address your issue about the usefulness of work experience, I agree to an extent. No work experience or shadowing could prepare me for what it actually feels like to have done 12 hours of work, with no break, hearing patients screaming on NOFU, with a million and one things to do and not enough time/staff to do it. And then on top of that going to a code black and everything going into meltdown. It was only my HCA experience that did that.\n\nAnywho, I would argue the biggest most defining moment for am I really in for this was in London HTD. A doctor, who was very respected and was very good with his/her patients, had previously been stuck in until 11pm the night prior to isolate a patient. He/she honestly was at breaking point. They said to me that they had previously been in another career and then did medicine, like me, as a graduate. They said did I want kids? Because by the time I graduate I'd hardly see them due to the fact I'd be doing night shifts still as a junior doctor, that he/she only ever saw his/her partner when they slept at night, and if they did have a rare moment together that they'd be too shattered to do anything but sleep. They said how they could barely function at work but still had to come in every day. It really hit me hard how close this person had come to snapping, and how the commitment I was choosing was huge, especially as a graduate. When doctors usually say on a hospital ward are you prepared for it, its not all its cut out to be etc they usually say it whilst being seemingly happy, albeit stressed, in their current position and in no hurry to leave it. However, this persons account really made me realise I wasn't choosing a job, particularly in the field I want to do, its a life choice rather than a career choice.\n\nI think realistically, you're in the way on work experience. And much doesn't change when you're on clinical placement at med school- you're a nuisance. You're slowing the doctors down so you never end up doing the same amount of hours as someone thats qualified, and you've got next to no responsibility for what you're doing. So I get what you're saying in that how can work experience truly be an insight. None of us will truly know what being a doctor is like until our first week as an F1- (and even then thats questionable)."", 'Thank you so much for all these videos!', ""At 9:40, Does  ward buddy count as a medical experience or more like volunteer? I do it once a week for 4 hours, where I mainly talk to patients and assist them by picking up stuff. However, I'm not allowed to perform any medical tasks or ask for private information from patients"", ""I sort of agree with you on the expectation of applicants to do hospital work experience and have moments of clarity that suddenly lead them to wanting to become a Dr. I can attest to spending 2 weeks on a ward following FY Doctors around when I was 16 being pretty much useless in terms of fully understanding the role and expectations of Doctors; is it an age thing? However, as a grad I've been working in a hospital for 3 years now in a HCA and more developed role where I've been able to work alongside Drs, Nurses and other Healthcare Professionals and I can tell you I've learnt an incredible amount and definitely feel more informed about my decision to pursue a place on a grad entry course. I don't really think I could take as much of an insight and relevant experience if I was volunteering in a different area as my paid role has allowed me to really get stuck in and develop skills and confidence in speaking to patients and contributing to their care rather than spending a small amount of time with patients on a semi-regular basis. Pros and cons of each I suppose!"", ""Couldn't agree more with your views on work experience, especially my hospital work exp in Pakistan (hi-5 on that btw) made me feel like I really shouldn't be there.

However, it is important to acknowledge that this is not an option for many people and engaging in these practices normalises unpaid work and contributes to greater systemic problem around inequality and who can or cannot afford to secure the best learning opportunities.', ""Agree, that the option to work for free is a luxury. I only looked for jobs to pay cause I had to pay bills and stuff. But I saved up money to earn that luxury of working free(working for learning opportunity). It's like working double to even the playing field. It is exhausting. One thing I would add, if you ever get ONE opportunity, MAXIMISE IT. It would lead to other paid opportunities.

I think showing interest and asking advice is great, but make your interest in the person genuine, otherwise it can leave them feeling used.

Not only does it show you've thought about how your experience maps, but your resume is more likely to make it past a computer screener (if they're using one) to a real human being. \n2) Include your school projects - since a college degree is supposed to be what will help a person in the job market, highlight the projects, skills, software, etc you learned, that fit the job."", 'Seriously, thank you so much for this advice.

Ms4xcowxG9g,"['Such a great video Ali! Always pushing me to make better and better content 💪', ""Hi Ali. \n\n\nFirst of all a big thanks for your video. I wanted to give back by saying two things. \n\n\nFirstly I recently purchased an A7 III + 24mm F2 + 50mm 1.8 + extra battery + Hahnel ProCube2 dual charger + pinky grip + battery grip all of which I'm loving and highly recommend. Will be selling all my Canon gear to make up the cost. The A7 III 15 stop dynamic range is just staggering bringing back images from pitch black and the 5 stop sensor stabilisation makes hand held shots possible at slow shutter speeds. The only drawback of this camera for me is to be able to hand hold with large hands - hence the two grips. Battery life is spectacular and I've not even got anywhere close to one battery running out.

I just returned from Antarctica for four weeks and on that trip I took the Shimoda Designs Explore 40. Check it out - I'm very happy with it. They also do other a 30L and 60L. It is water resistant and has insulated zippers all around which PD doesn't though the Shimoda doesn't have a side opening which you might like. :) I've also heard good things about Atlas but haven't looked into that one yet.

I know how to fix your posture and pot belly, your goal is not to lose fat, but gain more neurological control over mobilizing your joints! You do not have anterior pelvic tilt. You have an overextension of the lumbar, a lordosis with an excessive curvature inwards which pushes your belly forward. If you stand sideways, you will notice your lower back is curved inwards and your lower abdomen is portruded. You have to learn to flatten your back, alligning your lower back with your upper back instead of pushing your lower back forward. You should feel your vetrabae portruding on your back when you round your lower back. This pathological posture is a result of hip hyperextension and thoracic hyperextension. Try rounding your upper back and then push your hip back such that your legs are in front of your pelvic bone rather than behind, and then feel your lumbar curve the opposite way of its natural curvature, it’s called lumbar flexion. Posture is a position of your joints, it can be fixed in an instant in a minute, strengthening your musculoskeletal is a different story though. What you can do is learn to flex your lumbar and it will fix all your problems. Try standing with your legs and knees straight, hinge at the hip by pulling your hip backwards rather than forward, potracting your shoulders and let them hang free, then lower your body such that your lower back curves (feel your spinal flexors lower rectus abdominis flexing each vetrabae joint and feel your erector spinae also known as lumbar extensors stretch). Please try this it will work in an instant but understand that learning lumbar flexion and moving away from hip hyper extension to neutral/flexion is NOT about pelvic tilt. It’s a common misdiagnosis, you can have posterior pelvic tilt and still have lordosis, which I see you have. I imagine you sit leaning your upper back where your hip/glutes does not touch the back of the seat and your lower back doesn’t touch the backrest of the seat. This can lead to a lot of upper back pain and compression on the many pull musculatures of the upper back at your scapula. Next time you sit, I’d like you to put your butt to the back of the seat, do not lean with your upper back, dont let it touch, but lean with your lower back, angling a hinge where your upper back is forward from your lower back. Now, losen up the excessive spinal extension, let your spine flex and “round” and you will feel so much better. I notice whenever you sit, you sit like you’re standing with an obsession to extend your hip forward, never stretching the glutes. The anterior side of the pelvic bone should not always be portruded forward, and should be pushed back a little. Try curving your body down into a slouch rather than curving the spine into a “sit upright” posture. Try this out and it will fix your muscular imbalances.', 'Please like this so that Ali can fix his lordosis misdiagnosed as APT.', 'I procrastinate by watching your videos to feel productive 😂', 'Can relate', ""That's me"", 'Me too 😅', 'literally', 'Exactly bro', 'Ali: procrastinate 10min/day\nMe: procrastinate 10h/day', 'The best notion brand ambassador ever!', '5:14 \nU know his brain is really drained when he missed the pen spin twice', 'Lol', 'LMAO you go the metaphor', 'Ali you’re a legend.

Yesterday morning, our topic was GRIT, and they showed us Duckworth\'s TED talk.\n\nPrior to this, I don\'t think I had much problems with my grit. I had been studying on my own pace since our internship had been transitioned to online learning last March. I was already mentally prepared to study for whole days until September. Kind of both a marathon and a sprint, considering the coverage.\n\nHowever, yesterday, there had been an unofficial announcement that the exam will be moved to MARCH 2021 due to COVID. This really threw me off. I can\'t imagine myself studying all the way until March, which our review school encourages. I kind of shut down last night. The activation energy to study just increased.\n\nSo, thank you for sharing this video.\n\nIn relation to finding the purpose in what you do to strengthen your grit, I\'d like to share a question that we always ask ourselves when we hit a slump.\n\nIn Filipino, it is ""Para kanino ka bumabangon?"" which translates to ""Who do you wake up for?""\n\nIs it your family? Your future patients?

Fear creates resistance which creates more fear and it becomes an increasingly stronger cycle.\n- The solution is to interpret fear as a signal – fear is your compass. The more scared you are of something, the more important it is to you.\n- Become a Professional. A Pro understands fear and failure is part of the process, they show up to work no matter what, resistance is the daily battle. Conversely, an amateur's actions are mood-driven and goals are often extrinsic and hedonic (fun, money and status). \n- Hence, also make sure your goals are process goals (i.e. upload 2 videos every week), which are things you can control vs. outcome goals (get 1 mil subscribers) which are nice and to be celebrated but not the point.

Daily Reset - start with a fresh to do list every day, or you’ll get overwhelmed by the master one, it helps prioritize tasks\n2. The Box Method - when writing on paper, don’t just thick the box of the task at the end, instead use this progressive system to indicate progression on it: a line dividing the square, paint half, paint the other half, cross out the name of the task\n3. Real Time Adaptation - manage importance and urgency (cartesian plane)\n4. Check Up Round - have a plan for each project, from time to time check if needs to be changed and if it’s going smooth; with the data attribute a status based on color (red, yellow, green) and a next action step\n5. The 2 for 1 rule - 1 hour before 9 is worth two after 5, get up early\nAmazing video!!']"

I’d like to add a few thoughts based on my experience:\n\n1. If you have ADHD, it can be much harder to find satisfaction in any job - whether it’s a 9-5, freelance work, or running your own business. You’ll need to find ways to keep your motivation up with multiple tasks because, no matter how amazing one task is, you’ll eventually get bored. This is also why people with ADHD tend to have multiple careers rather than sticking to one long-term.\n\n2. Most people don’t actually want to run a business - they just like the idea of having one and see it as a magic pill that will solve their current struggles.\n\n3. The idea of working on your side hustle while keeping a full-time job only works if your 9-5 truly ends on time and leaves you with enough energy to pursue your business goals after work and on weekends.

I did what you suggest in the past and more: I sacrificed, I worked overtime for years, I tried to adapt to any changes that came my way. I learned new skills.

Meaning, you don't have to go to university to learn how to cook, talk to girls, do your own laundry, etc. In fact, the university will baby you much more than 'real life'.  If anything, this is a point for non-university life. You will experience rejection, as well as all sorts of lifelong lessons outside of Uni at a much faster pace. I noticed I was way ahead of the curve compared to my friends at university. I had to pay for everything, cooked and shopped for all my meals and was already starting a business/working full-time. \n\nI think you have to calculate the opportunity cost as well as the cost of school alone. You completely skated over the opportunity cost, which is significant. Imagine what you could do with 4 (or more) years + 30-60k a year to travel, attend workshops, work internships, etc. \n\nIf you want to go into a science field, such as medicine or engineering, university is a no-brainer. The vast majority of university graduates are not getting a great deal. If you want to 'do art' or start a business, avoid university at all costs.\n\nI think it's easy to look at your own life and project that most people will benefit from the university experience. The reality is that the majority of jobs do not require a college degree, and most people would probably benefit from jumping into 'real life'."", 'Agreed', 'As someone who did an ""Arts"" degree, I can testify it\'s essentially a useless endeavour.

The 1% rule\n2. Screw goals and focus on systems instead\n3. Identity change rather than outcomes\n4. The 4 fundamental laws of behavior change\n\n---\n\n1. The 1% Rule\n    - If we can get 1% better each day for a year we become 37X better (1.01^365)\n    - Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement\n    - When we repeat bad habits day after day they will accumulate into larger problems\n\n    > Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally and bad habits make time your enemy — James Clear\n\n    - The plateau of latent potential. We think that results are going to be linear and we'll keep getting better or improving at something at a consistent pace. This isn't how habit building works. You stick with something and then you improve exponentially. This is when the compound interest of self-improvement takes hold and we see amazing results.\n\n---\n\n2. The Problem with Goal Setting\n   1. Winners and losers have the same goals. Goal setting doesn't differentiate you.\n   2. Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. When we achieve a goal we only change our life for a moment. It's the systems that cause those results in the first place. \n   3. Goals restrict our happiness. There's an implicit assumption behind any goal that once a goal is reached you will be happy. \n   4. Goals are at odds with long-term progress\n\n   > The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. — James Clear\n\n   > The score takes care of itself — Bill Walsh\n\n3. Identity Change is the North Star of Habit Change\n   - Three layers of behavior change\n        - Outcomes\n        - Processes\n        - Identity\n\n    Most of us work from outcomes to identity rather than identity to outcome\n\n> The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when it becomes part of our identity — James Clear\n\n4. The 4 fundamental laws of behavior change\n    1. Make it obvious\n       - Design your environment. Put fewer steps between you and the good behaviors.\n    2. Make it attractive\n       - Relates to the craving aspect of the habit loop. Make habits attractive.\n    3. Make it easy\n       - Reduce friction and prime your environment for habits you want to develop\n    4. Make it immediately satisfying - attached some sort of immediate gratification\n       - What is immediately rewarded is repeated\n       - What is immediately punished is avoided\n\n---\n\n- The great power of atomic habits is the emphasis it places on systems rather than goals, identity rather than outcomes, and small habits rather than drastic change.\n- Habits are not a finish line, but a lifestyle to live."", 'Thankyou!', 'The summary of the summary', 'Great summary', 'Thanks 🙏', 'Great summary', 'I randomly applied these things to my life back when I wanted to be one of the best players of a game in our country.

The problem is, the unemployment rate here is so high that trying to get a part time is almost impossible. \n\nI started writing stories. I earned a bit through it, just enough to get by in that month. But it all worked out in the end. I'll graduate as an ophthalmologist in a year. I'll be 29 by then.

However there is one thing that you have to keep in mind: If you change the meaning of the word “racist”  you also limit the ability for People of color to express the concept of racism in its original form. Think about this: You can’t say that someone is antisemitic against a catholic person. Antisemitism is the discrimination against Jews. So if you say a black person can say racist things about a white person than kind of erase the essence of the word.  In the books I read, no one is denying that People of color can’t discriminate other races. But they use the word “discrimination” not “racism”.

Go-first (be the first one to break ice)\n2. Nothing in life is that complicated, everything is figureoutable IFF you actually do it\n3. When buying things, think about how they can help you - consume, create, connect\n4. Say no to things that can\'t get you respond with ""hell yeah""\n5. Never watch TV alone - only when with friends: frees up time. Basically, don\'t do anything that, when consumed now, cannot bring you as great satisfaction as you could if you delay your consumption to some other time/circumstance\n6. 0 -1 > 1 - 1.1: from nothing to something is more important than improving on something that you already have. eg. getting a camera. \n7. Perfection is the enemy of good (don\'t get so bogged down with the idea of ""uh i need to be absolutely perfect at this otherwise i\'m a total loser"". No, perfection will discourage you from actually starting to DO things, and accepting normality will actually lead you to perfection)\n8. pareto principle\n9.reitoff principle\n10. Journey before destination (goal is important for direction, but once we\'ve set that goal, it is important to focus less on the goal, but on the journey to the goal itself. In other words, ACTION instead of being a day-dreamer)\n\nSome tips from me:\n1. Try to use the ""watch later"" button more. Whenever you feel like procratinating via wathcing another luring youtube video, use that and say to yourself I will enjoy it later. \n2. Do the right thing - and then have the courage to be hated by others\n3. Don\'t be scared of sharing your ideas - others will value your idea as much as you value theirs\n4. Always think that everyone in this world is unique in some way, and always be interested in making friends with everyone and then try and find out in what ways they are special\n5. Sometimes procrastination is good for you, what\'s not good for you is the feeling of hating yourself for procrastinating, or hating yourself for hating yourself for procrastinating ... \n6. Mimicking is the basis of studying, so don\'t be afriad of sharing ideas that are not your own, in doing so, you might actually come to find something different, and in doing so, you are offering an opportunity to others to see something amazing', ""1. Consume, create, or connect for new tech\n2.  Invest in new things rather than upgrades\n3. Hell yeah or no to opportunities\n4. Perfect is the enemy of good - get started and improve iteratively\n5. Only watch TV with other people\n6. Go first - initiate interactions with others\n7. Pareto principle - 80% of value comes from 20% of inputs\n8. Reitoff principle - 'write off' days so you can have guilt-free time off\n9. Journey is more important than a destination - happiness is never a destination\n10. Everything is figure-outable - you can do anything that is humanly possible"", 'Journey is more important on destination. Happiness is never a destination', 'I found this video very helpful but I think my favorite tip is the “you go first”. I used to be the type of person to wait for something to happen, especially when interacting with others but now I enjoy taking initiative! Even if it goes wrong, I learned something!']"

I almost only know people who do a lot of useful (to them or to others) and fulfilling things in life.  they don't earn a lot of money from it, but that's not their motivation either.   (for example:  I know quite a few volunteer red cross workers who put in a lot of hours for nothing, besides working a full time job, having a family, keep a active social life and besides all that also do some painting, writing, reading, or some other quite but still productive activity)  it's really not that uncommon.  Earning a lot of money from it is more uncommon.  Most people in the world will never be able to get that much money even if they worked just as much.  But most don't have that ambition, they just want to feel fulfilled and doing makes you feel fulfilled (at least more fulfilled then dreaming about doing or worse dreaming about having).\nOnce you get in a rythm of doing it's remarkably easy to keep doing and eventually you will look at your life and maybe be amazed at what you actually do (allthough this is offcourse within the boundaries of your own limitations.  for some only doing one thing is in their capability - due to a chronic illness for example.  but if that's the most they can do, then they are just as productive as this guy, even though he will be able to do more things.  still what he does is not that incredible for a healthy person, and very much doable. - not that I want to diminish his efforts for getting to this point in his life, but I just want to point out that it's something I see many people do, allthough they might not get into any spotlight ever in their life.)  A human being loves doing, creating and exploring possibilities, it's due to social limitations and negative thoughts that some get caught up in an unproductive circle.

Ie: even the relatively inconsequential? \n2: If a 16/17 year old refuses treatment and their parent's ALSO refuse treatment what happens? Are the parents allowed to refuse on their child's behalf? \n3: Similarly, with an under-16 Jehovah's witness refusing a life-saving transfusion, alongside their parents refusal, would you accept the decision or pursue legal routes? \n4: Regarding advance directives or LPA's; Presumably details of these included within patient notes? Is this something that would be difficult in emergency settings, perhaps with an unidentified patient or in a situation where time precludes contacting and discussing with the LPA?

Music is basically a way of self-medicating dopamine if you think about it. I personally think that, it also depends on the task at hand which also brings a layer of stimulation to your brain.

Connect our goals with our personal values (and exercise our autonomy)\n2. Reminder that we genuinely care about the outcome\n3. Set identity-based goals\n4. Make effort intrinsically motivating\n5. Choose your mindset', 'The 5 Key Tips (S.R.I.I.M.)\n\n1. Sense of Self: Why you want to do it? I choose to, I want the outcome... No one is forcing me.\n2. Reminder: At times remind yourself, the reason why, and the reward you will get later.\n3. Identity Based: I am the sort of person, I want to be, I aspire to be ""x""\n4. Intrinsically Motivating: See it as a challenge (fun) rather than a reward, So, when you feel the most pain, and frustration tell yourself that it will be worth it later, and it\'s what you love (tricking it into being fun)\n5. Mindset: I get to, I am choosing to, I\'m blessed to. Identified motivation\n\nI hope this helps you. Good day/night to you ! and Goodluck!', 'Here is what I learned:\r\n\r\nThere are four types of motivation: Intrinsic, Extrinsic, Introjected and Identified.\n\r\nIntrinsic motivation is internal and arises from within the individual, such as doing a complicated crossword puzzle purely for the gratification of solving a problem. An example of intrinsic motivation is watching Netflix or playing video games because you enjoy them. However, intrinsic motivation can be fragile and easily diminished by external factors, such as difficulty, feedback, or rewards. When things become a little bit harder, you may feel demotivated and quit.\n\r\nExtrinsic motivation arises from outside of the individual and often involves external rewards such as trophies, money, social recognition, or praise. An example of extrinsic motivation is studying for an exam overnight because you want to get a good grade or avoid failing. Extrinsic motivation can be effective in some situations, but it may also reduce intrinsic motivation if the rewards undermine your sense of autonomy or competence.\n\r\nIntrojected motivation is a type of extrinsic motivation that involves internalizing external pressure or expectations. For example, you may exercise because you feel guilty about being overweight or want to avoid criticism from others. Introjected motivation is not very self-determined and can lead to anxiety or resentment.\n\r\nIdentified motivation is a type of extrinsic motivation that involves recognizing the personal value or importance of a behavior. For example, you may want to be a youtuber and so you start learning how to create good youtube videos because you see it as a necessary step for your future self. Identified motivation is more self-determined than introjected motivation and can enhance your sense of autonomy and competence.\n\r\nHow to stay motivated:\n\r\nSelf-concordance is to connect your goals with your personal values. This means choosing goals that are consistent with your interests, passions, and beliefs. For example, if you value creativity, you may set a goal to write a novel or learn a musical instrument.\n\r\nRemind yourself that you genuinely care about the outcome. This means focusing on the intrinsic reasons why you are pursuing a goal rather than the extrinsic rewards or pressures. For example, if you want to learn a new language, remind yourself how much you enjoy learning new things and how it will enrich your life.\n\r\nSet identity-based goals. This means framing your goals in terms of who you want to be rather than what you want to do. For example, instead of saying “I want to run a marathon”, say “I am a runner”. This way, you can align your actions with your self-image and reinforce your identity every time you act on your goal.\n\r\nMake efforts more intrinsically motivating. This means finding ways to make the task more enjoyable or rewarding by itself rather than relying on external incentives. For example, you can listen to music while working out, join a study group with friends, or gamify your progress by setting challenges or milestones.\n\r\nI hope this helps. 😊', 'This video came at a very good time where my ""motivation"" has been running low.

I also use it as a sketchpad when I'm practicing shapes or trying to give an idea a rough sketch while I'm out and about. I've found that parts of the work I like to do are limited on the iPad in general so I have a macbook as my workhorse with a large drawing tablet for that serious work.

I would love it if the mini had the pro motion display but I am so glad it has the laminated screen. That is one distinction I'd throw in for new artists wanting to use the iPad for art.

When you read about Da Vincis personal life, especially as a child, you learn that he was incredibly impatient and very easily distracted. His tutor struggled with him daily, and you realize that these texts make it sound like Da Vinci has some form of what we’d diagnose as ADD or ADHD. But even though he was different, Leonardo learned how to do things his own way. He was left handed, so he wrpte all of his personal notes from the right side of the page to the left side, a style known as Mirror Script. There was no particular reason for this, except for the fact that this style is just Leonardo’s brain felt the most comfortable doing. But he realized that mirror script was complicated to regular people, so in all of his non-private writings (letters to family and friends,) he writes them all regularly from left to right. Dude was such a genius that he taught himself how to be ambidextrous. But the modern school system would have 100% stamped out all of this, and made him conform.

For those actually looking for a budget backpack, go for something like a Targus Classic. It’s cheaper, robust, and you won’t trash the (relatively) expensive contents within like you would with a Jansport (which isn’t made for carrying pricey tech). I wish they (yes - “they”) put as much love into showing the best options at all price points as they did in plugging the stationery.', 'They just wrote bag in amazon then bought the first promoted one lol.', 'In their defense, premium and luxury bags are more affordable than premium and luxury tech. Meaning, they were probably able to easily come up with ideas for the budget options by asking staff, friends, etc., but no one actually had a budget option they already used.', 'Agree , it comes off  disingenuous', 'Premium and luxury brands really aren’t more affordable though. When I was a student, I wouldn’t dream of spending over £100 on a backpack. And the two Peak Design models in this video aren’t a good illustration of Premium vs. Luxury backpacks (I know PD well - I’ve put money in a few of their kickstarter campaigns). Peak sells at different price points for different needs, and both Peak bags in this video are premium products, targeting a photography niche (same as Tumi or Briggs & Riley are also premium, targeting business users). Luxury bags have a broad price range and prioritise style over practicality. For example, a luxury alternative to a Jansport could be a Coach backpack, whilst designer brands (e.g. Gucci, Burberry etc.) would be a the top-end, costing much more than the most expensive Peak backpack. “Luxury” is subjective, and relative to the buyer but regardless of definition, those on a budget would not consider premium or luxury bags, nor would they find them more affordable (especially when money is better spent on a laptop, for example). The sub-£50 market is excellent for backpacks, and if Ali were indeed on a budget, I don’t believe for one second he would choose to put his gear in that Jansport (which is for school kids or packing some T-shirts on a weekend away). They could’ve done better to illustrate some good options available at lower price points (like Targus) which are just as durable and practical as a Peak, but without the premium materials and nice touches. That’s why the “budget” example feels shoehorned for “relatability” (subs and likes are all equal, after all). No one was asking for a budget option, but if you do it, you might as well do it well. This wasn’t done well.', 'Yes. The budget version wasn’t really thought through, besides the price. I have a bag from ikea that’s designed better than that and can carry tech safely. It had no style and no function. The products didn’t even list their features as to why these were the best versions of budgets. Unfortunate and kind of lazy. I know he’s not a tech reviewer. But… at least do some research and sign posting.', 'I feel that the budget version was made to be a defence system against ""You are rich"" comments. The backpack, as you said ""a random bag from amazon"" - there could be better options. The laptop is alright. Tablet section - as you said with the iPad mini ""a glorified kindle"" you could have recommend a Kindle or a budget e-reader - good for reeding books or documents. The camera section: while the idea of having a camera to take pictures is valid and I\'d say makes the experience better it does not mean that you need a camera - recommending to spend that money towards a higher end iPhone or Android phone would have been better - it would also take great photos. \n\nTo summarize the budge section feel rushed and seems like there was little to no research of each item. I mentioned at the begining the it seems like a defence against \'You are rich"" comments - I\'m not against having nice things. You have made it, You can have nice things, but when trying to create a budget version put some time into reaserch.', 'I felt the same way. Incase bags are a great affordable option. Lumix has some great budget cameras that do everything the Sony that he recommended does for around $350 dollars. And like you said, a kindle option would have been great. Definitely felt like not a lot of thought and time was given to the budget option.\n\nOverall, I thought it was a great video and not trying to knock anyone who can afford nice things! I definitely wish I could afford a Leica. Just wish it felt like the same amount of time and research was given to each option listed.', 'Jack Wolfskin Dayton is about the same price as the Jansport and has YKK zippers and great materials. German brand', 'What I thought was weird is he even mentions the a6000 as his first camera during the budget option and you can buy it for $300 but chose the a6400 to show. The a6000 still a great camera that many people still use.', '🍍', 'Thought the “budget” options came across as really dismissive verging on a complete afterthought. No real substance to any kind of review of the gear. Don’t mind if you carry what could be considered as “expensive kit” if it’s what you carry but I’d avoid the here’s a “cheap” option, if it’s just done in a vain attempt to maintain some kind of relatability.

Naturally to start off with there is nothing there to recall at all - EMPTY = Nothing to recall at all. \n\nThen to get some content in so you have something to AR in the first place we all can have our ways of getting the content in. The smiley lady in the clip gave a method to start adding in some content in ie: Reading some totally new content - covering it and seeing if  you can repeat what it without looking = AR \nRehearsing or reciting some content a few times so there is a little of something in my mind that wasn't there before and then seeing if I can RECALL it = AR\n\n\nAt this stage, the content is very fragile and needs incubating if it is to survive. That's why I feel the spaced repetition is such a good second pillar. Ie don't wait a week to find the content has withered away but make sure that I have a way to get back to it before it dies lol, and wastes the time and effort invested in getting it in there in the first place.  \n\n\nAt the end of a study session to see if the info is still in your mind by seeing if you can recall it = AR \n\nThanks to these videos,  whenever I go to a subject to learn I start by calling up from my mind what I know so far = AR and is a pleasure as well to see what I know increasing. \n\nAt the end of about 20 min studying a topic, I stop and see what i can RECALL = AR \n\nI have a set of small topic cards and regularly I just look at each card and see what I can RECALL for about 20 seconds per card = AR  (good boost this one when you see how much knowledge you have stored in your mind and an easy way to keep a load of content growing) \n\nTelling a friend what I can remember = AR \nRecalling what I can on a long drive = AR \n\nPlanning to pop the Topic headings onto audio that I can hear a topic heading, press pause, see what I can recall and then press play to listen to the next heading and repeat \n\n\nHope that's helpful - these videos certainly have been. \n\n\nI welcome any comments \n\n\nPaul"", 'Thank you!', 'Thanks mate', 'Thank you!', 'Helpful\nThank you sir', 'Thank you so much for this!!! 🙏🙏🙏❤❤❤✨✨✨', 'For me last minute revision is the day before :(', '😂', '@astro explorer It tend to happens but studying no matter the hour', 'Paul is working at Boss level!

Never heard of him afterwards. Cancelled my gym as soon as possible (one year later). And I recovered all by myself. It cost me way more than any minor benefit from the workout itself. My grand parents are 94 and 95. They don't go to the gym either. Just get off your lazy bum, go walking, cycling and working outdoors. But don't think that a gym will only make you healthier, because other good habits will improve your health even more. Some people love the gym. In our family we hate it.

Don't get me wrong, having a bike ride or run is wonderful! But it won't let you grown muscle as lifting heavy weights. In my case I'm just lucky because as you say, I do it for fun (for many reasons but I mostly really enjoy lifting heavy weights), and my commute to the gym is less than 10 minutes.

Another way to stay fit in your upper body is to do heavy gardening work, such as chopping wood, lifting heavy things, this non-static way of training your core is much better for longevity than looking yourself in the mirror at the gym.

I use it for taking notes on literature, annotating papers and drafts, planning, idea dumps, everything really. For me the mini is better and I really don't miss the bigger one; it feels more like a notebook and less like a computer to me. It fits in every bag I own, even super tiny ones, I don't notice/resent the weight like I did with the pro, and so I'm more inclined to take it absolutely everywhere with me which makes it more useful. Writing in landscape doesn't feel cramped to me at all.\n\nThe one thing the mini really *doesn't* work well for is split screen (I've used it at conferences in a pinch but it really is too small). If that's something you think you're likely to use, I think it might be tough to make it work, but if you are using it as a planner that might not be a concern for you anyway.\n\nTry it out if you can and see how writing on the mini feels to you - I tended to use small notebooks before I was paperless so maybe that's why I adjusted quickly, but I really do think it's big enough for regular notetaking - I've written hundreds of pages on it - and if compactness is a consideration it's unbeatable.

A track pad, mouse support, and a proper keyboard, however\n - This also makes the iPad a worse tablet. It is almost unusable as a drawing device, you can't use it in a flat orientation (like on a desk, or in your hand while roaming around as Ali might), and the keyboard offers no protection once removed to use the ipad flat or for drawing (obviously)\n\nYou should not need to remove a $300 accessory from your tablet to use it as a tablet, nor should you have to turn it upside down either. So then why price an accessory that turns the ipad into a better computer device, and a worse tablet at a similar cost to an ipad 7 on its own? \n\nWell I would argue that it is because Apple wants you to consider it as a full laptop replacement. Here's why:\n - At $300+ for the keyboard, and $1000 base for the ipad pro, you're in macbook air/pro pricing territory ($1350 for the base 12.9 ipad pro + magic keyboard)\n - If the keyboard was priced at $100-$150 (as some 3rd party alternatives might be), then there is a risk of this setup undercutting sales of mac devices. \n - So Apple wants you to make this choice without losing anything from its own bottom line\n - The fact that it has a trackpad almost renders the pencil redundant, so again the choice would be - ipad + folio case + pencil for a tablet experience with some computer ability or ipad + magic keyboard for a nearly complete computer experience with limited tablet ability\n\nBy introducing this keyboard, Apple has now given people 3 choices, not just 2: 1. If you want a complete computing experience with no tablet functionality - then get a macbook, 2. If you want a complete tablet experience (drawing, flat-lay use) with some computing ability, then get an ipad pro with a pencil and/or folio, 3. If you want a very good computing experience, with the option of a still-decent tablet experience (you can still use the tablet outside of the keyboard, but not protected and not at case-defined angles), then get yourself an ipad pro + magic keyboard.\n\nThank you for making it all the way to the end of my comment, and thank you to SkillShare for sponsoring this comment"", 'You said everything. But I chose option 4 : to have a very good tablet with the smart folio keyboard, and connect my ipad to a computer, magic trackpad and Logi keyboard for long typing experiences.

The 5 minutes of silence helps me come to a natural stopping point, noticing the music stopped. The applause gets my attention if I don’t notice the music stopped, and celebrates I got a little extra work done. \n\nReviewing is writing down what went well, what didn’t go well, what I need to focus on next.

How you score is up to you, but I add up my original estimates for each task I completed.

I\'ve consumed >65 books in the last year and what it allows me to do is listen to multiple books on similar subjects and I get the material and insight from different authors from different angles.

You can find lots of audio books on <ahem> youtube, or use apps from your local library to start out so you don\'t have to subscribe to Audible.

You aren’t “procrastinating on starting yt channel” if you’re a full time student and prioritizing other things.\nBeating Ourselves Up\n- Procrastination is an evolutionarily useful mechanism where we prioritize short-term gains. This is useful since cavemen tried to run from tigers, not self-actualize. Understand that procrastination makes sense and is useful when trying to conserve resources and survive, don’t beat yourself up for procrastinating.\nPressing the ""Try Harder"" Button\n- Whenever you catch yourself saying solution is to “just try harder” button, that’s not a sustainable way to get things done.\nPeople vs. Systems\n- Treat yourself as a machine, not a human. Can’t just make a computer work twice as fast without changing something in the code. Think “what is the system I can designed around this to make myself more likely to do the thing?”\nThe Uphill Boulder\n- Make process enjoyable, try not to think of the thing as boring or meaningless. This is not a sustainable way to be productive, think of how to make the thing more energizing?', 'Ali is productively pouting in the thumbnail.

It's very subtle, but it makes the video feel more natural."", 'Good advice Ali! I can totally relate with pushing the try harder button. It rarely works.

Also ask yourself what information you are looking for. Ask yourself a relevant question before. \n1.2) you read the chapter and stop after every paragraph to close the book and revise what you\'ve just read. (tips in ""2"")\n\n1.3) check if you missed on something. If not write it down in a shorter way and also try to figure out a question one could ask you about that paragraph (of course several questions)\n1.4) before you revise the next paragraph, revise the one before again. And then search for the connection of them!! \n\n2) the way you revise the paragraph and its information you\'ve just taken out of it, works best if you imagine yourself staying infront of a class/ group of friends, and you actually explain the information. (sort of a lecture) \n\nAnd as Ali recommended before: \n3) put your questions into anki :) \n4) repeat with spaced repetition \n\nNever forget that learning is always something that requires your whole body; stand up when revising, actually loudly explain things to yourself, awaken your emotions desire why asking yourself why you need to know this. \nLast but not least: accept that some topics will always be harder than others. Just revise them a little more often and it will stick! :)\n\nDo yourself a favor and start ASAP!', ""I'm not a native speaker, so....

So like do you believe in God or science and your opinions on all that (The question you said you were gonna answer on your live thingy) - And a random question that I thought of due to things I've heard people say: if you follow and believe in a religion, doesn't that make you religious because you'd follow the law or rules or whatever that comes with it so why in some instances, people say they're for example Christians but say they're not religious? What's the difference? (I know you can add philosophical spin to things so go ahead! That's the most interesting part!😂👌)\n\n3) How to get out of friendships that aren't benefitting to you? So not necessarily toxic, but just not adding value your life or giving you anything useful for the future. Or is it worth having those sort of friendships too?\n\n4) Is it necessary to have a dream? And/or what can push you to reach for the stars ( e.g A*) if you don't necessary have an end goal yet? So other than needing motivation, people usually have goals so they never seek other means of getting motivated. \n\n5) Is having a relationship alongside studies or work or alongside the other rigors of life a good thing? / How to get out of the mindset that you need to be in a relationship? / Or how to get out of the mindset that you'll avoid ever being in a relationship because you assume it'll hinder your studies/ work in life? (That's me lol due to the absurdity of high school relationships and how people end up depressed and unable to work - makes me view relationships as pointless and a void full of short term happiness and long term sadness/ depression as an end result)\n\n- It was hard to not link any question to school or University, considering my life pretty much revolves around school. Hopefully those questions gave you general ideas of discussion topics! Lovely video as always!

So helpful! You rock!', 'I felt the same way lol, so very wild to see myself and get such a thoughtful response.', ""Hi Morgan, Patrik here (the guy who was in the video as well). What helped me during my Bachelor's Thesis and my studies in general was having dedicated time slots to write, as Ali suggested. However, the bigger impact came from differentiating between motivation and discipline. I often didn't feel like writing my thesis, but since I was already at the library, where I had written all of my thesis, I should be disciplined and do the work instead of procrastinating. Telling myself that motivation is not a factor in whether I do the work or not helped massively. I wish you a lot of discipline, you‘ll get your PhD in ko time🙌🏻"", ""Hey Morgan, glad Ali was able to help! \n\nIf it helps, the brain only has 3-6 hours of good cognitive activity a day. A couple of things you could do is instead of committing to hours, as Ali suggested only commit to a shirt period of time. Then when you're finding you're struggling or your mind is all tapped out, head out for a walk or do some kind of activity that is really far removed from what you were doing that doesn't need any kind of focused attention. Giving your brain that chance to diffuse helps you do creatively problem solve in a way that you can't do when you're focusing in thr thick of it. That's why you'll get some of your best breakthroughs when you're having a bath, exercising or even doing the dishes!\n\nProcrastination isn't a bad thing, it can be some of the most productive time you have if you know how to do productively procrastinate! 😉"", 'Can I make a suggestion? As someone who struggled with this, and just finished herself, one of the things that help me was setting targeted goals/objectives. One thing that helped me get and stay motivated was doing projects that aligned with my dissertation. Presentations, and talks about your work keeps your mindset on your work. If you pin your dissertation as a side project ( not saying that it is, but sometimes we treat it they way we treat a hobby we had at one point but loss time to continue doing it), then it’s going to continue to be there as a side bar. You need to bring it back as a main focus. If you haven’t yet defended your proposal, that is also a motivator. Getting chapters submitted is also a pusher because they are tangible targets. Meet with your advisor come up with a regular meeting time and some initial deadlines to work towards. Break it down and set it up. 😂', 'Go Morgane! You got this! 🎉', 'The pomodoro technique has done wonders for me! \nFor me, I do a \'reverse pomo\' where I do longer ""focused"" sessions and then sessions get shorter throughout the day.\nTherefore, morning at 9am, I do 75min with 20min break or 75/20\nthen I do: \n60/20\n50/15\n45/15\n35/10\nas the day progresses. And it works!', ""Okay that's a pretty interesting way of doing focused work. Good mental focus hack. End of the day we'd completely avoid any work that required 60 mins of focus. But 25 - 35 mins, easy as watching a tv episode."", 'I am going to do this', 'What ali abdaal wears on his right hand, what was that, what its use ??', 'I have a similar approach, where I would do 3 or 4 sessions of 50/10 in the first part of the day and 3 or 4 sessions of 30/10 in the evening.', ""I seldom leave comments, but there is something about Ali's videos that I watch straight till the end, not even speeding the playback.

Thanks, Morgan, for asking a great question!!', ""You're welcome! Omg, I'll have to go follow your channel!!"", 'By a wild synchronicity, I have a PhD in Theater Studies!  YOU CAN DO IT MORGAN!!!!!!  100% agree about lowering the stakes to overcome friction.  What helped me was writing 1 page/day = 1st draft in 8ish months, or whatever numbers work for you - the idea that small gains over time operate like walking up a less steep ramp.  You still ""get there"" but without tired legs :).  I never wrote for four hours in any one day.    Also, in addition to his incredible advice, Ali\'s videos turned me on to London Writers Salon -  they\'re a beautiful online writing community with multiple Zoom writing hours each day to accommodate different time zones.  Highly recommend, especially if you feel like you\'re at sea without a structure post comps/prospectus.', 'Omg, hi fellow theatre studies scholar!! Where did you get your degree??

Once i get home from work i will be doing the idea, experiment iterate work and then the THIRD DOOR?! my mind is blown and Ali explaining this also had me in tears. I relate so much eith Alex also about the rejection amd also personally, feeling like im making no progress in life. What a great and insightful video', ""Man I love how ali really looks into helping people to their goals with not desimating that person\n\nAli you are amazing Thank You for making the 1 dollar course it opened my mind to the possibility's for youtube"", 'I left my job to try an entrepreneurial endeavor and when times got tough I used the third door to find my way back. After getting myself back on my feet I’m working on my next entrepreneurial endeavor 🙏🏾', 'To Morgan: I feel for you. I was in your position: trying to complete a doctorate with a full-time job and other commitments long after everyone in my original cohort had finished. Take heart; you will be successful. One of the things to help lower the ""hump of procrastination"" (Ali alludes to it when he talks about plan and prepare) is to harness the power of classical conditioning (I was a ""rat runner"" as an undergraduate psych major). That\'s the thing Pavlov discovered with the dog salivating at the sound of a bell. We react, physiologically and emotionally, to an ""irrelevant"" stimulus when it\'s paired often enough with something that can be expected to elicit a response. Pavlov paired a bell with food so often that the dog\'s natural response to food—salivation—became a response to a bell ringing, which is otherwise irrelevant to digestion.\n\nSo start pairing stuff with the start of your dissertation time. Establish a ritual. Get your special mug and your special tea that you only use/drink when you\'re ""dissertating"" (that\'s what my kids called it). Light your special candle. Say your magic words three times. Invoke the Goddess. Set your intention. Whatever. (As a theatre major, you know the power of ritual in performance.) You\'re trying to make the presence of the ritual objects/actions elicit and sustain a mental state (calm, focused mind).Then, using the other tools Ali suggested, start your doctoral work. Setting the ritual shouldn\'t take more than 3 or 4 minutes. You don\'t want to spend your valuable work time running around finding ritual objects. But a few minutes engaged in ritual can pay off in increased productivity.\n\nDo this enough and eventually your ritual will help ground and focus you, and lower the hump of procrastination. Like most people here I suspect, I use a timed work/break system (I use a modified pomodoro). So do your ritual not only at the start of a block of work time, but at the beginning of every work period after your short breaks. Eventually your fidgety mind will recognize and respond to, ""Here\'s the special mug. And the candle. And the magic words. It\'s time to calm down and focus.""', ""i think it is quite hard to start with almost all, but the easier way is yo start bit by bit, enjoy, it will get the passion automatically, then when it's coming dont stop ..""]"
